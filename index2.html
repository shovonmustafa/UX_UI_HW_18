                <p> This government redesign was to redesign the home page layout 
                    and UI to make it easier for the user to navigate the website. 
                    The original website was cluttered and a lot of the navigation 
                    did not align with headings.

                    and Find Me Gluten Free to make an easily accessible app that helps 
                    users with allergies.

                <p> 
                    In this project I used my basic knowledge of coding to create a 
                    portfolio for myself. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to write this.
                    I am still working on my coding, but I have a general understanding of
                    the different languages.

                <h4> Prototyping and Creating Wireframes</h4>
                <p> I enjoy creating wireframes and prototypes. When playing around with different ideas you 
                    can really see what works and what doesn't. Taking an idea and creating
                    a prototype is one of my favorite things about UX/UI design.

                <h4> Communication</h4>
                <p> My communication skills are one of my best qualities. I am a stickler
                    for making sure everyone involved in a project is in the loop and up to date. If communication
                    is poor then the end result will also be poor.

                <h4> Agile Methodologies</h4>
                <p> In my previous role I was trained to use the Agile approach on projects and I started
                    to really like it. It made working through projects much more organized and easy to accomplish.
                    And as always... iterating is key!

                <h4> Information Architecture</h4>
                <p> 
                I enjoy information architecture is because it is all about oragization. You go through a website and
                take it apart, then reorganize it like a puzzle. When redesigning a webiste I focused on making
                the redesign clean and easy to navigate.
